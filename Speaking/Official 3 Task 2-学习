Question
  Some students prefer to work on class assignments by themselves. 
  Others believe it is better to work in a group. Which do you prefer? Explain why.

示例回答：
  I prefer to work on assignments individually. There are two reasons. The first is that I like to be in a quiet place while studying.
  If I study in a group, I will always be interrupted by group members who talk about irrelevant things. 
  Then it’s possible that I can’t even finish the assignments. Once, I attended a group discussion. Many people were not even discussing. 
  They were just talking about NBA games. When it ended, I got nothing from it. The second reason is that I’d like to think independently. 
  Studying individually gives me enough time to develop my own ideas. When studying in a group, I will always be distracted by other’s opinions and thoughts.
  So sometimes many assignments are not done by myself but by other group members. Like last week, I worked in a group to solve math problems. 
  It turned out that many problems were solved by others not by myself. I felt very unhappy about it.
