Question：
Using points from the lecture, explain how the passion plant and the potato plant defend themselves from insects.


示例回答：
According to the professor, there're two ways for plants to protect themselves from insects. 
The first one is physical defense; some plants like passion plant have physical features that prevent insects from landing on them. 
The passion plant has little spiky hairs that cover the whole leave. Since the spiky hairs are numerous and dense, 
the insects can hardly find room to stand on leaves, and therefore cannot eat leaves. Another one is chemical defense, 
like the one potato plant uses. When attacked by insects, the plant releases a chemical over its leaf system, 
which discourages the insect from further eating the plant by making the insect feel full,
so the insect may think it's already had enough and stops eating. In this way the potato plant protects itself from insects. 



1. Physical defense 物理防御
2. Prevent insects from landing 防止昆虫降落
3. Chemical defense 化学防御
4. Release a chemical 释放化学物质
5. Discourages the insect from eating 使昆虫不愿意进食
6. Feel full 感到饱腹
