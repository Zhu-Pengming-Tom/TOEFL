Question：
  Using points and examples from the talk, explain the difference between active and passive attention.

示例回答：
  Active attention is voluntary, it occurs when students force themselves to pay attention, so it won't last for a very long time. 
  For example, you're teaching in a biology class, and you are describing the frog to students. If you only describe it by lecturing,
  students will get distracted easily because they are paying active attention that is hard to keep. However, passive attention is involuntary,
  it happens naturally without any effort, and it lasts longer. If something interesting happens, students begin to pay passive attention
  even without being aware of it. For example, in the same class, if you describe the frog by showing the students a live frog instead, 
  they will be interested and therefore pay their passive attention. As long as the frog is still there the students will focus on the class.
