Question：
Using the examples of Leafy Sea Dragon and the Cuttlefish, describe two kinds of camouflage and the benefits they provide.


示例回答：
    Some sea animals, in order to survive from predators, 
    develop some kinds of camouflage to blend in with their environment. 
    One of them is a kind of fish called leafy sea dragon. 
    It looks like a green dragon with small leaf-like protrusions sticking out from its body like arms.
    Its color and shape help it to perfectly match with its environment. When it's swimming among the green sea plants; 
    it looks just like the sea plants, so its predators are not able to detect it. 
    But the camouflage will lose its efficacy if the fish enters a different surrounding without the plants.
    So there's another kind of camouflage that is able to change as circumstances change. For example, 
    the cuttlefish has shifting pigment that allows immediate color change if need be, 
    so it can always go with its surroundings to avoid being recognized and eaten by predators wherever it is. 


1. Camouflage 伪装
2. Perfectly match 完美匹配
3. Lose its efficacy 失去效力
4. Shifting pigment 变色素
5. Immediate color change 立即变色
6. Go with its surroundings 与周围环境相协调
7. Avoid being recognized 避免被识别
