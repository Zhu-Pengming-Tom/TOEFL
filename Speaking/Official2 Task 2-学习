Question
  Some college students choose to take courses in a variety of subject areas in order to get a broad education. 
  Others choose to focus on a single subject area in order to have a deeper understanding of that area. 
  Which approach to course selection do you think is better for students and why?


示例回答：
  Well, I think taking a wide variety of courses is better for students. Because, first of all, 
  I think undergraduate study is meant for broadness. Students had better broaden their horizon and prevent themselves from being narrow-minded.
  Second of all, I think before students find their “true love”, I mean, the subject they really want to go deep into, 
  they should probably extend their study field and taste different subjects in various areas so as to identify the “true love”. 
  Take myself as an example, my major is software engineering in the college, but I took various courses outside my major field.
  Then I found out that I was more interested in literature than in computer and software. So literature is my “true love”. I think it depends
