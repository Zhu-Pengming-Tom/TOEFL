      [~]There are various adaptations to help as much of the pollen go as far as possible. [~]Most deciduous wind-pollinated trees (which shed their leaves every fall)
      produce their pollen in the spring while the branches are bare of leaves to reduce the surrounding surfaces that “compete” with the stigmas
